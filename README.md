Flappy bird clone the art made with Paint.Net

this is the gist of what the functionality of the game is:

the pipes go from right to left after a pipe has gone out of frame its position is reset back to the right of the screen out of frame and the gap between the pipes is also reset

after the bird crashes into pipes it's best score is shown which is only saved at run time in other words will not be saved from one game session to the next

the background is doing Parallax scrolling is done there is 3 rectangles with different textures that move in different speeds to the left of the screen, each background rectangle is drawn 2 times in different positions per frame the second draw always follows the rectangle.
