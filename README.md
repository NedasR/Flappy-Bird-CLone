Flappy Bird clone the art made with Paint.Net.

This is the gist of what the functionality of the game is:

+ The pipes go from right to left after a pipe has gone out of frame its position is reset back to the right of the screen out of frame and the gap between the pipes is also reset.

+ After the bird crashes into pipes its best score is shown which is only saved at run time in other words will not be saved from one game session to the next.

+ The background is doing Parallax scrolling is done by 3 rectangles with different textures that move at different speeds to the left of the screen, each background rectangle is drawn 2 times in different positions per frame the second draw always follows the rectangle.
